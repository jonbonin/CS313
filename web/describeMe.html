                            I am currently in my 8th semster of college.
                            The major that I have decided to go into is web development with a business emphasis.
                            The reason that I am going down this route is because I enjoy the learning process of challenging mys self when I am making a new website or project.
                            It is aslo a lot of fun for me to be able to create what a will oiled website with just text and to be able to go through that creative process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I have from the San Francisco pay area, and I went to georgia on my mission. I have had a lot of fun in both places, and have learned a lot.
